% Symbol	Value
%    I	           1
%   V	          5
%   X	          10

% I placed before V or X indicates one less, so four is IV (one less than five) and nine is IX (one less than ten)
% I placed after V or X indicates one more...

% inputs: sroman - Roman symbol
% output: arabic - Neumerical value
function arabic = roman (sroman)
    % get the index of I in sroman
    % get the index of V in sroman
    % get the index of X in sroman
    % get count of I
    % get count of V
    % get count of X
    % I is on left
    % If ((count (V) | count(X)) & count (I) & (index(I) < index (X) | index(I) < index (V)))
    % arabic =
